### Heading

# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
### Heading level 3


### Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.

I really like using Markdown.

I think I'll use it to format all of my documents from now on.


### Line Breaks
To create a line break (<br>), end a line with two or more spaces, and then type return.
