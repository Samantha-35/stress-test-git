To create a heading, add number signs (#) in front of a word or phrase. The number of number signs you use should correspond to the heading level. 
For example, to create a heading level three (<h3>), use three number signs (e.g., ### My Header).

Heading Best Practices
Markdown applications donâ€™t agree on how to handle a missing space between the number signs (#) and the heading name. For compatibility, always put a space between the number signs and the heading name.

Paragraphs
To create paragraphs, use a blank line to separate one or more lines of text.
